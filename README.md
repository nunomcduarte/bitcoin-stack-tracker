## FIFO Calculation Explained

The application uses the FIFO (First In, First Out) method to calculate your cost basis and capital gains:

1. When you sell Bitcoin, the application assumes you're selling the oldest Bitcoin in your portfolio first
2. The profit or loss is calculated as: (Sell Price - Buy Price) Ã— Amount Sold - Fees
3. Capital gains are classified as short-term (held less than 1 year) or long-term (held more than 1 year)

## Development

This is a simple client-side application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No build steps or dependencies are required. Bitcoin price data is fetched from the CoinGecko API.
